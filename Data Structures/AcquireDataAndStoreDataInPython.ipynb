    "- At line `#2` is where the actual quering of the API occurs. The `requests` package will connect to the URL, retreive the data and store it in an easy-to-use python object. This data is then store in a variable called `response`\n",
    "- Line `#3` prints the result of our `request` call. The varible `response` if of type `Response` and shows us one value, 200. This is the status code from the HTTP server. A status of 200 means that everything went smoothly.\n",
    "- Now we need to actually work with the data that we received from the cat fact web API. This is done on line `#4`. The `requests` package makes working with JSON data extremly easy, by simply invoking the `.json()` method. This will in return, provide a JSON object of the result (if the result was written in JSON format, otherwise raise an error). Since we know JSON objects are key/value based, this becomes a dictonary type in python, which makes retreiving information a piece of cake.\n",
    "- The raw JSON (dictonary) data is printed on line `#5`. This shows all the data we have to work with.\n",
    "- From the API, the `text` field contains the fact. The other fields, such as `status`, `_id`, etc, provide extra information about the fact. Line `#6` prints out the fact to the console.\n",

    "An _author_ will consist of the author's name and an `id` that will incriment every time a new author is inserted into the table.\n",
