This is a repository I use for learning "Machine Learning Engineer - Starter" Career Path.
The Learning Path can be found in [this link](https://platform.qa.com/training-plan/machine-learning-engineer-fundamentals-7c0e7741-f963-43bf-bdf9-1a78d6f6a5ee/).

## Description
If you're new to machine learning or want to move into a new role in machine learning, this is the ideal starting point for you!

You’ll start by learning the basic principles of machine learning: so, artificial intelligence, the release process for a machine learning model, and various out-of-the-box services that you can use as well.

We’ll then move on to look at a comprehensive range of content designed to give you a solid foundation in everything to do with data. You will learn about datasets and their various formats and interfaces, the SQL language and how to run SQL queries, the differences between databases and spreadsheets, how to use Python for data exploration, and finally, different data visualization techniques.

We'll finish off with an intense deep dive into the world of machine learning, in which you'll learn how to implement different machine learning models, validate their quality, and how to implement them practically.
